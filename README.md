### The World Is Stranger Than You Think...
The World Is Stranger Than You Think...
Everything that you read in the tabloids is true. The telephone company is
controlled by the Moonies. The Congressional Wives have taken over the Pentagon.
The Druids are casting spells to destroy the IRS. Hitler is still alive... or at least his
brain is, in a jar... and you wouldn’t believe where it’s hidden. Mad scientists are
building Orbital Mind Control Lasers... aimed at you!
You’ve always known it. Secret conspiracies are everywhere. They’re out to get
you — unless you get them first.
Now you are one of the Illuminati, the “secret masters” competing to take over the
world. World leaders, multinational corporations, and entire nations are merely your
pawns. The outcome is never certain until the final double-cross...
### What’s in the Mysterious Little Box?
This is a game for 2 to 6 players. The __Illuminati: New World Order (INWO)__
starter set includes this rulebook and two boxes of 55 cards. You can get Booster
Packs and boxed sets of cards to add to your collection.
You’ll need two 6-sided dice. Each player also needs about 15 “Action tokens”
(glass pebbles are good) and a few pairs of distinctive markers for “links.” And, of
course, the drive and cunning to walk over your friends in your quest for world
domination.
### The World Is At Your Feet...
**INWO** can be played two ways:
Head-to-head, with two players: It’s all in who builds the best deck, makes the best
plan, and takes best advantage of circumstances. Go for the throat! A two-player
game takes 30 minutes to an hour (see Two-Player Rules, p. 17).
In a group, with three to six players: Diplomacy, negotiation and guile are vital.
And be ready to defend against all your foes when you get close to winning. Length
of the game depends on how much time you spend negotiating before you attack;
typically, the game takes 20-30 minutes per player.
### Object of the Game
The object of **Illuminati** is to control the world. You start with a single Illuminati
card, representing your own secret conspiracy. During the game, you will add other
Groups to your Power Structure, and perhaps take Groups away from rival Power
Structures. You can use Plot cards to advance your own position or harass your foes.
You may win by controlling enough Groups, or by fulfilling the special goal of
your own Illuminati, or by meeting the objectives on a Goal card. Or, of course, by
destroying all of your foes!
## BASIC RULES
### Beginning the Game
(1) Each player must have his own 45-card (including
your Illuminati) INWO deck. The relative number of
Plot cards (cards with a hand on the back) and Group
cards (cards with a puppet on the back) in your deck is
up to you; typically, a strong deck will have 12-20 Group
cards and 24-32 Plot cards. Designing a strong deck,
with cards that enhance each other’s strengths and cover
for each other’s weaknesses, will help you win.
<br>(2) Each player divides his cards into a Plot deck and a
Group deck. The Plot deck will include Plots (cards with
blue backgrounds or blue title text) and possibly extra
Illuminati cards (cards with black backgrounds and four
outgoing control arrows). The Group deck will include
Groups (cards with red backgrounds or red title text) and
usually Resources (cards with purple backgrounds or
purple title text).
<br>(3) Each player puts his starting Illuminati card on the
table face down. Once everyone’s Illuminati card is on
the table, flip them face up. Note: In some games, more
than one player has the same type of Illuminati... which
means they represent different factions of the same
conspiracy (see Duplicate Cards, p. 14).
<br>(4) Each player shuffles his Plot deck and draws three
Plot cards for his starting hand. You may look at your
cards, but you cannot play any of them until the game
actually begins. These are your first “hidden Plots.”
<br>(5) Each player selects one Group from his deck as a
“lead” — the first puppet of his Illuminati. Each player
puts his lead on the table face down. Once everyone has
a card on the table, flip them face up. If two or more
players chose the same lead Group, put the duplicates
aside. Those players select new lead Groups that do not
duplicate any that have already been chosen. Continue
until everyone has a lead Group (or runs out of Groups).
Each player puts his lead Group on one of his Illuminati
control arrows (see Control Arrows, p. 6). You may not
lead with a Resource — it must be a Group!
<br>(6) Each player shuffles his Group deck and draws six
Group cards (or the entire deck, whichever is less) for his
starting hand. Any duplicates that were put aside in the
previous step are shuffled back into the owner’s deck
after he draws his starting hand. From now on, you may
not look at, or trade, any of your undrawn cards — just
the ones in your hand.
<br>(7) Each player rolls two dice. The one with the
highest roll goes first.
At the beginning of the game, you may not do anything
to a rival who has not yet completed his first turn! You
may not interfere with their attacks or target them with
any card (however, you may play cards that affect all
players, such as New World Order cards. The abilities of
your Groups and Resources (even ones that work all the
time at no cost) do not affect a rival who has not finished
his first turn.
Exception: If someone attacks you during his first turn,
you are free to respond against that player in any way
you can.
