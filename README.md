### The World Is Stranger Than You Think...
The World Is Stranger Than You Think...
Everything that you read in the tabloids is true. The telephone company is
controlled by the Moonies. The Congressional Wives have taken over the Pentagon.
The Druids are casting spells to destroy the IRS. Hitler is still alive... or at least his
brain is, in a jar... and you wouldn’t believe where it’s hidden. Mad scientists are
building Orbital Mind Control Lasers... aimed at you!
You’ve always known it. Secret conspiracies are everywhere. They’re out to get
you — unless you get them first.
Now you are one of the Illuminati, the “secret masters” competing to take over the
world. World leaders, multinational corporations, and entire nations are merely your
pawns. The outcome is never certain until the final double-cross...
### What’s in the Mysterious Little Box?
This is a game for 2 to 6 players. The __Illuminati: New World Order (INWO)__
starter set includes this rulebook and two boxes of 55 cards. You can get Booster
Packs and boxed sets of cards to add to your collection.
You’ll need two 6-sided dice. Each player also needs about 15 “Action tokens”
(glass pebbles are good) and a few pairs of distinctive markers for “links.” And, of
course, the drive and cunning to walk over your friends in your quest for world
domination.
### The World Is At Your Feet...
**INWO** can be played two ways:
Head-to-head, with two players: It’s all in who builds the best deck, makes the best
plan, and takes best advantage of circumstances. Go for the throat! A two-player
game takes 30 minutes to an hour (see Two-Player Rules, p. 17).
In a group, with three to six players: Diplomacy, negotiation and guile are vital.
And be ready to defend against all your foes when you get close to winning. Length
of the game depends on how much time you spend negotiating before you attack;
typically, the game takes 20-30 minutes per player.
### Object of the Game
The object of **Illuminati** is to control the world. You start with a single Illuminati
card, representing your own secret conspiracy. During the game, you will add other
Groups to your Power Structure, and perhaps take Groups away from rival Power
Structures. You can use Plot cards to advance your own position or harass your foes.
You may win by controlling enough Groups, or by fulfilling the special goal of
your own Illuminati, or by meeting the objectives on a Goal card. Or, of course, by
destroying all of your foes!

### Beginning the Game
(1) Each player must have his own 45-card (including
your Illuminati) **INWO** deck. The relative number of
Plot cards (cards with a hand on the back) and Group
cards (cards with a puppet on the back) in your deck is
up to you; typically, a strong deck will have 12-20 Group
cards and 24-32 Plot cards. Designing a strong deck,
with cards that enhance each other’s strengths and cover
for each other’s weaknesses, will help you win.
<br>(2) Each player divides his cards into a Plot deck and a
Group deck. The Plot deck will include Plots (cards with
blue backgrounds or blue title text) and possibly extra
Illuminati cards (cards with black backgrounds and four
outgoing control arrows). The Group deck will include
Groups (cards with red backgrounds or red title text) and
usually Resources (cards with purple backgrounds or
purple title text).
<br>(3) Each player puts his starting Illuminati card on the
table face down. Once everyone’s Illuminati card is on
the table, flip them face up. Note: In some games, more
than one player has the same type of Illuminati... which
means they represent different factions of the same
conspiracy (see Duplicate Cards, p. 14).
<br>(4) Each player shuffles his Plot deck and draws three
Plot cards for his starting hand. You may look at your
cards, but you cannot play any of them until the game
actually begins. These are your first “hidden Plots.”
<br>(5) Each player selects one Group from his deck as a
“lead” — the first puppet of his Illuminati. Each player
puts his lead on the table face down. Once everyone has
a card on the table, flip them face up. If two or more
players chose the same lead Group, put the duplicates
aside. Those players select new lead Groups that do not
duplicate any that have already been chosen. Continue
until everyone has a lead Group (or runs out of Groups).
Each player puts his lead Group on one of his Illuminati
control arrows (see Control Arrows, p. 6). You may not
lead with a Resource — it must be a Group!
<br>(6) Each player shuffles his Group deck and draws six
Group cards (or the entire deck, whichever is less) for his
starting hand. Any duplicates that were put aside in the
previous step are shuffled back into the owner’s deck
after he draws his starting hand. From now on, you may
not look at, or trade, any of your undrawn cards — just
the ones in your hand.
<br>(7) Each player rolls two dice. The one with the
highest roll goes first.
At the beginning of the game, you may not do anything
to a rival who has not yet completed his first turn! You
may not interfere with their attacks or target them with
any card (however, you may play cards that affect all
players, such as New World Order cards. The abilities of
your Groups and Resources (even ones that work all the
time at no cost) do not affect a rival who has not finished
his first turn.
Exception: If someone attacks you during his first turn,
you are free to respond against that player in any way
you can.<br>

### Turn Sequence
Each turn has the following steps:
### *Beginning of Turn*
During this portion of your turn, you may only use
Action tokens to buy Plot cards, to power Plots or special
abilities that directly affect one of the Beginning of Turn
phases listed below, or in response to some other Plot,
special ability, or action. Plots and special abilities that
do not require an Action token are not affected by this
restriction.
+ (1) Draw the top card from your Plot deck, if you
wish. At the same time, you may exchange Action
tokens on your Groups for additional Plot card draws
(see “Any Time” Moves, p. 3).
+ (2) Draw the top card from your Group deck, if you
wish.
+ (3) Make one automatic takeover, if you wish. Choose
any Group or Resource from your hand. You bring it into
play automatically — no die roll is required.
If you choose a Group, place it so its incoming control
arrow aligns with an outgoing control arrow in your
Power Structure, without overlapping any other Group
(see Control Arrows, p. 6). You may not duplicate a
Group already in play unless a card specifically allows it.
If you choose a Resource, put it beside your Power
Structure. You may not duplicate a Unique Resource
already in play unless a card specifically allows it.
+ (4) Place an Action token on each of your Groups that
doesn’t already have one (see Action Tokens, p. 3). Some
Resources (the ones that have the word “Action” at the
bottom) also get Action tokens.
### *Main Phase*
+ (5) Attempt attacks or other Main Phase actions.
During the Main Phase of your turn, you may perform
these actions as many times as you like (except the ones
that say “once per turn”), in any order:
	- Attack to control or destroy a Group: This uses an
action from the attacking Group. (See Attacks, p. 7)
	- Move a Group to a different control arrow: You
may spend an action to move a Group during the Main
Phase of your own turn. A Group can be moved to
another player’s Power Structure during the Main Phase
of either player’s turn, if both players agree and one of
them pays the Action token cost. (See Moving Groups,
p. 12)
	- Create or move links: Some special abilities work
with specific “linked” cards. (See Links, p. 14)
	- Give or trade away a Resource you have in play:
You may give a rival one of your Resources during the
Main Phase of either of your turns, as long as you have
not used the Resource earlier in the turn. The Resource
is then linked to the recipient’s Illuminati; he can re-link
it during the Main Phase of his turn. (See Gifts and
Trades, p. 12)
	- Play a Resource: Once per turn, you may spend an
Illuminati action to bring a Resource from your hand
into play.
	- Trade an Illuminati action for a Group card: Once
per turn, you may spend an Illuminati action to draw a
Group card from your deck.
deck.
### *End of Turn*
- (6) Use Plots or special abilities that happen “at the
end of your turn” (such as the Bermuda Triangle’s
special ability).
- (7) Knock. Rap on the table to alert the other players
that you’re finished. An evil laugh is appropriate here.
At this time, any player(s) (including the one who just
knocked) who has achieved one of his Goals may declare
victory. If someone declares victory, any player may use
Plots or special abilities to thwart or secure the victory.
Action tokens may be used to buy more Plot cards or to
power Plots and special abilities. However, nobody can
make an attack (it’s not the Main Phase of anybody’s
turn) unless a Plot or special ability allows it.
If one player declares victory and is not thwarted, he
wins! If two or more players declare victory and are not
thwarted, they share a victory... unless they are factions
of the same Illuminati (see Winning the Game, p. 16).
If no one wins, the current turn ends and the next
player to the left starts his turn. Play continues
counterclockwise until a player or coalition of players
wins.
	Note: If any Plot or special ability says that your turn
ends “immediately,” skip the rest of the turn sequence —
the current turn ends and the next player starts his turn.
Yes, this means that no one can win during the turn that
was cut short!
### “Any Time” Moves
You may do the following things during any part of
your turn, or even during somebody else’s turn, unless a
rule or card text prevents it:
- Trade Action tokens for Plot cards: At any time, you
may exchange one Action token from your Illuminati or
two Action tokens from your other Groups for one Plot
card drawn from your deck. This does not count as an
“action” by the Group(s) that provide the tokens, and
your rivals cannot use action-canceling Plots or abilities
to prevent it.
- Use a special ability of one of your Groups or
Resources: Some abilities can be used at any time;
others are limited to certain times or circumstances.
Read the card text to see how its special ability works,
when you may use it, and what costs (actions, discards,
etc) you must pay.
- Play a Plot card: As with special abilities, read the
card text to see how the Plot works, when you may use
it, and what costs you must pay.
- Discard any card from your hand or return a Plot
card to your deck: You may voluntarily get rid of cards.
If you have too many Plot cards (see Limits on Plot
Cards, p. 5) or Goals (see Winning the Game, p. 16) in
your hand, you must immediately get rid of the excess.
(See Discards, p. 4 and Returning Plots to Your Deck,
p. 5)
- Give away or trade cards from your hand: You can
give gifts or make trades as part of your negotiation
strategy. (See Gifts and Trades, p. 12)
- Aid or oppose an attack: Whenever a player (you or
somebody else) makes an attack, you may aid or oppose
it unless something prevents you from getting involved,
such as Privilege. (See Aiding or Opposing Attacks,
p. 8)

	It’s usually wise to avoid using up all your Plots and Action tokens during your turn, so you’ll have some available to defend yourself or meddle with your rivals’ plans. If you don’t use up your Action tokens before your turn comes around again, you can trade them in for Plot cards just before you get new Action tokens (but keep in mind that you may be vulnerable to certain attacks, such as the Giant Kudzu...)
