### The World Is Stranger Than You Think...
The World Is Stranger Than You Think...
Everything that you read in the tabloids is true. The telephone company is
controlled by the Moonies. The Congressional Wives have taken over the Pentagon.
The Druids are casting spells to destroy the IRS. Hitler is still alive... or at least his
brain is, in a jar... and you wouldn’t believe where it’s hidden. Mad scientists are
building Orbital Mind Control Lasers... aimed at you!
You’ve always known it. Secret conspiracies are everywhere. They’re out to get
you — unless you get them first.
Now you are one of the Illuminati, the “secret masters” competing to take over the
world. World leaders, multinational corporations, and entire nations are merely your
pawns. The outcome is never certain until the final double-cross...
### What’s in the Mysterious Little Box?
This is a game for 2 to 6 players. The __Illuminati: New World Order (INWO)__
starter set includes this rulebook and two boxes of 55 cards. You can get Booster
Packs and boxed sets of cards to add to your collection.
You’ll need two 6-sided dice. Each player also needs about 15 “Action tokens”
(glass pebbles are good) and a few pairs of distinctive markers for “links.” And, of
course, the drive and cunning to walk over your friends in your quest for world
domination.
### The World Is At Your Feet...
**INWO** can be played two ways:
Head-to-head, with two players: It’s all in who builds the best deck, makes the best
plan, and takes best advantage of circumstances. Go for the throat! A two-player
game takes 30 minutes to an hour (see Two-Player Rules, p. 17).
In a group, with three to six players: Diplomacy, negotiation and guile are vital.
And be ready to defend against all your foes when you get close to winning. Length
of the game depends on how much time you spend negotiating before you attack;
typically, the game takes 20-30 minutes per player.
### Object of the Game
The object of **Illuminati** is to control the world. You start with a single Illuminati
card, representing your own secret conspiracy. During the game, you will add other
Groups to your Power Structure, and perhaps take Groups away from rival Power
Structures. You can use Plot cards to advance your own position or harass your foes.
You may win by controlling enough Groups, or by fulfilling the special goal of
your own Illuminati, or by meeting the objectives on a Goal card. Or, of course, by
destroying all of your foes!
